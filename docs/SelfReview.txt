There are two aspects of our design in particular that we wish we had done differently. The first
is that our ReversiTile interface was imported by classes outside the model package (the view).
This does not make the code inherently wrong, but it doesn't perfectly follow the principles of the
MVC design. This could've been fixed by changing the return types of methods in the model that
expose ReversiTile. Specifically, getTileAt should be replaced with something like isDiskAt and
getColorAt, and the getTiles method should be replaced with a map of Point to TileEnum, which could
be either EMPTY or NOTEMPTY (there could be other fixes for this, that's just one idea).
The second aspect is the model listeners. Instead of having two methods to add a listener, it would
have been easier to old have one method that took in arguments to specify which events the listener
would want to receive.

Our experience with our provider's was amicable and reasonably efficient. There was some confusion
over why we asked them to change their code, but once we further explained how parts of their code
was too coupled, they fixed it and sent it back in a timely manner.
