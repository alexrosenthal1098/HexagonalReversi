The Player interface only provides one method: getNextMove

A class that implements this interface is saying that they can play the game Reversi. The model,
is not aware of who is playing the game. It only cares about what moves are being made (or
attempting to be made) so that it can enforce the rules of the game and update itself. Keep in mind
that the interface does not force a player to perform the move on the model, but simply return what
move they have chosen to play. This allows for more flexibility in how the game is played. (maybe
the player's chose moves are be randomized, maybe there are specific tiles that have secret
attributes we don't want the player to know about, etc.)

If you wanted to represent a human player, a class would implement this interface and then get
input from the user. Neither the interface nor the model cares how this happens, as it could be
done many ways (e.g. the console, GUI, etc.). The user inputted move would then be returned by the
getNextMove method.

Alternatively, if you want to represent an AI player, a class would implement this interface and
then use some sort of logic (again, we don't care about the details of this logic) to decide what
move to play next.
